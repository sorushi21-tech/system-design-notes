    "# Distributed Caching:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Distributed caching stores data across multiple cache nodes (servers), enabling horizontal scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance for large-scale applications. It is essential for microservices, cloud-native systems, and any backend requiring low-latency access to shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Cache capacity and throughput grow by adding more nodes.\n",
    "- **High Availability:** Data is replicated across nodes; failure of one node does not result in data loss.\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance:** Automatic failover and recovery mechanisms ensure reliability.\n",
    "- **Networked Access:** Applications access cache over the network (TCP/IP), introducing some latency compared to local caches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular Distributed Cache Solutions\n",
    "- **Redis:** In-memory, supports clustering, replication, persistence, pub/sub, Lua scripting. Widely used in Java via Jedis, Lettuce, Redisson.\n",
    "- **Hazelcast:** Java-native, supports distributed maps, queues, topics, and more. Integrates with Spring Boot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Partitioning and Sharding\n",
    "- **Consistent Hashing:** Distributes keys evenly across nodes, minimizing rebalancing when nodes are added/removed.\n",
    "- **Manual Sharding:** Application logic determines which node stores which data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Replication and Consistency\n",
    "- **Master-Slave Replication:** One node is the source of truth; others replicate data for read scalability and failover.\n",
    "- **Multi-Master Replication:** All nodes can accept writes; requires conflict resolution.\n",
    "- **Consistency Models:** Eventual consistency, strong consistency (via distributed locks or consensus protocols).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cache Invalidation Strategies\n",
    "- **Time-To-Live (TTL):** Automatic expiry after a set duration.\n",
    "- **Explicit Invalidation:** Application sends commands/events to remove/update keys (e.g., Redis pub/sub).\n",
    "- **Versioning:** Store version/timestamp with each entry to avoid stale reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preventing Cache Stampede and Avalanche\n",
    "- **Request Coalescing:** Only one thread fetches data from the DB on a cache miss; others wait for the result.\n",
    "- **Randomized TTLs:** Prevents mass expiration and DB overload.\n",
    "- **Background Refresh:** Proactively refresh hot keys before expiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Considerations\n",
    "- **Authentication/Authorization:** Use ACLs, passwords, or certificates to restrict access.\n",
    "- **Encryption:** Enable TLS for data in transit; encrypt sensitive data at rest.\n",
    "- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate cache nodes from public networks."
