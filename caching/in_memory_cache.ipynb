    "# In-Memory Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In-memory caching stores data directly in the application's memory (heap or off-heap), providing ultra-fast access with minimal latency. It is ideal for caching frequently accessed, non-persistent, and non-shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "- **Ultra-low latency:** Data retrieval is faster than network or disk-based caches.\n",
    "- **Local to JVM:** Each application instance maintains its own cache. No network call required.\n",
    "- **Volatile:** Data is lost on JVM restart or crash. Hence not suitable for critical or persistent data.\n",
    "- **Limited by heap size:** Large caches can cause GC pressure and OOM errors. Use with care in memory-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Java Libraries\n",
    "- **Caffeine:** High-performance, near-optimal eviction, async refresh, and statistics.\n",
    "- **Guava Cache:** Simple, thread-safe, supports expiration and size-based eviction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Patterns\n",
    "- **Method-level caching:** Cache expensive computations or service calls.\n",
    "- **Session/user data:** Store user-specific state for fast retrieval.\n",
    "- **Hot data:** Cache frequently accessed reference data (e.g., config, lookup tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices to use in-memory cache\n",
    "- **Size limits:** Prevent unbounded memory growth.\n",
    "- **Monitor hit/miss ratio:** Tune cache size and expiry for optimal performance.\n",
    "- **Avoid caching large objects:** Can cause memory fragmentation and GC issues.\n",
    "- **Thread safety:** Use libraries with built-in concurrency support.\n",
    "- **Integration:** Use Spring Cache abstraction for annotation-driven caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- **Not shared across nodes:** Not suitable for distributed systems requiring consistency.\n",
    "- **No persistence:** Data loss on restart.\n",
    "- **GC impact:** Large caches can increase GC pause times. Consider off-heap or distributed cache for large datasets."
