    "# Cache Eviction Policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Eviction Policies Matter\n",
    "Eviction policies determine which items are removed from the cache when it reaches its capacity. Choosing the right policy is critical for maximizing cache hit ratio, minimizing latency, and ensuring efficient memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Eviction Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Least Recently Used (LRU)\n",
    "- Removes the item that has not been accessed for the longest time.\n",
    "- Well-suited for workloads with temporal locality (recently accessed items are likely to be accessed again).\n",
    "- Widely supported (Caffeine, Guava, Redis, Memcached).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Least Frequently Used (LFU)\n",
    "- Removes the item with the lowest access frequency.\n",
    "- Good for workloads where some items are accessed much more often than others.\n",
    "- More complex to implement and manage than LRU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. First-In, First-Out (FIFO)\n",
    "- Removes the oldest item in the cache, regardless of access pattern.\n",
    "- Simple, but may evict hot items if they were loaded early.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Time-To-Live (TTL) / Expiry\n",
    "- Items are evicted after a fixed duration, regardless of access.\n",
    "- Useful for ensuring data freshness (e.g., config, session tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Random Replacement\n",
    "- Randomly selects an item to evict.\n",
    "- Simple, but generally less effective than LRU or LFU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Strategies\n",
    "- **Segmented LRU (SLRU):** Divides cache into segments for new and frequently used items (used in Caffeine).\n",
    "- **Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC):** Balances recency and frequency for better hit rates.\n",
    "- **Custom policies:** Tailor eviction to business needs (e.g., priority-based, cost-aware)."
