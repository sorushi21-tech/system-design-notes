    "# Caching Pattern Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)\n",
    "- Application checks cache before querying the database.\n",
    "- On cache miss, data is loaded from the DB and stored in the cache for future requests.\n",
    "- Most common pattern in Java (e.g., with Spring Cache, Caffeine, Redis).\n",
    "- Pros: Simple, avoids stale data, works well for read-heavy workloads.\n",
    "- Cons: First request is slow (cold start), risk of cache stampede on popular keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Read-Through Cache\n",
    "- Application always queries the cache; cache itself loads data from the DB on a miss.\n",
    "- Cache provider manages data loading and population.\n",
    "- Pros: Transparent to application, consistent cache population logic.\n",
    "- Cons: More complex cache setup, may introduce latency if cache is slow to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Write-Through Cache\n",
    "- Writes go to both the cache and the database simultaneously.\n",
    "- Ensures cache and DB are always in sync.\n",
    "- Pros: Strong consistency, no stale data in cache.\n",
    "- Cons: Write latency increases, risk of partial failure (write succeeds in one but not the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Write-Behind (Write-Back) Cache\n",
    "- Writes are made to the cache and asynchronously persisted to the DB.\n",
    "- Pros: High write throughput, reduced DB load.\n",
    "- Cons: Risk of data loss on cache failure, eventual consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Refresh-Ahead Cache\n",
    "- Cache proactively refreshes data before it expires, based on access patterns or TTL.\n",
    "- Reduces cache misses and cold starts for hot keys.\n",
    "- Pros: Consistent low-latency for frequently accessed data.\n",
    "- Cons: May refresh unused data, requires careful tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Pass-Through Cache\n",
    "- Used for expensive computations or API calls (e.g., third-party services).\n",
    "- Cache stores results of expensive operations to avoid repeated processing.\n",
    "- Pros: Reduces load on backend and external services.\n",
    "- Cons: Must handle cache invalidation and TTL carefully.\n"
